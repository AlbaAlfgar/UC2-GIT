## Electronics
Here you'll find the schematics for the wiring parts of the U2C parts. 

## Wire Diagrams/Schematics
All Schmeatics are put together with the Open-Source Software "Fritzing" (http://fritzing.org/)

Most connections can be established with pin-connection (male/female). For durable connection, please solder everything! You're not expected to have perfect soldering skills though. Look up some youtube-tutorials on "How to solder wires" are alike. Take care, that you're not mixing up +/- to prevent any shortcuts which are very likely frying the Pi or the Arduinos.
