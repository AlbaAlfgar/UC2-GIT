# The BOX
Very soon we would like to ofer a ready-to-use box being able to make a growing number of different optical experiments possible. 

Useful for Workshops. Get back to use if you want to organize one together with us!

## Necessary Parts 
A file which lists all modules and components necessary to build one of those boxes can be found [here](./DOCUMENTS/Bill_of_Materials_In-Incubator-Microscope_v0.xlsx).

The overall price-tag is around 600â‚¬ including the Raspberry Pi, Camera, Optics, 3D printed parts and all additional components.
