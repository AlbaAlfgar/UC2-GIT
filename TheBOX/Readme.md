# The BOX
Very soon we would like to offer a ready-to-use box being able to make a growing number of different optical experiments possible. 

That's how it could look like:

Useful for Workshops. Get back to use if you want to organize one together with us!

## Necessary Parts 
The detailed up-to-date list of all components can be found in this [google-spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vh9hyDPg2nbcnaBAXX8jAnEIwKx_D-sa/view?usp=sharing).

The overall price-tag is around 600â‚¬ including the Raspberry Pi, Camera, Optics, 3D printed parts and all additional components.
