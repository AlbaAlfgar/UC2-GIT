## DOCUMENTS
Here you'll find all the necessary documents for the system. 

Please look into the seperate .MD files for further information. 

### Uc2 Tutorials
We want to make our system accessable and easy to use. Therefore we have made a small design guide, where we describe the key steps for designing additional components which will be compatible with our system. 

* [Assembly Guide for the Incubator Microscope](./TUTORIALS/TUT_Assembly_In-Incubator_Microscope_v0.pdf)
* [Design Guide for new customized UC2 inlets](./TUTORIALS/TUT_Basic_Design_Cube_Inlet_Function_v0.pdf)


### Ressources
We compiled some lists with available low-cost components (e.g. lenses, filters, etc.) to make the setup affordable. 
You can find them here:

1. [Ressources: Optics, Objective lenses, Filters](./RESSOURCES/Ressources_Optics.md)
2. [Ressources: Light Sources, Lasers](./RESSOURCES/Ressources_Lightsources.md)
2. [Ressources: Electronic Parts, Controlers](./RESSOURCES/Ressources_Electronics.md)
2. [Ressources: Electromechanics, Motors](./RESSOURCES/Ressources_Mechanics.md)

### A list of links
