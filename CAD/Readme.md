## CAD-Files
Here you can find the necessary .stl-parts for the different setups. 

This should serve as a growing list of available optical setups. The most important part is the core building block as you can also find it in every modular toolbox. A detailed description of the the **uC2** cube can be found [here](./BASE_CUBE/Readme.md). 

## Printing
The .stl files can be downloaded and printed. We use an Ultimaker 2+/3 and DeeGreen which is precise enough. Note, that not all parts might be necessary to print. A detailed description or compiled list of necessary parts will follow soon. 

## List of available setups:
- [IN-INCUBATOR_MICROSCOPE](./IN-INCUBATOR_MICROSCOPE/Readme.md)
- [INLINE_HOLOGRAM](./INLINE_HOLOGRAM/Readme.md)
- [LIGHTSHEET-Scanning](./INLINE_HOLOGRAM/Readme.md)

More are coming soon! 

## Participate
If you have a cool idea, please don't hesitate to write us a line, we are happy to incorporate it in our design to make it even better.
