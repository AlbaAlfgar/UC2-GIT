## CAD-Files
Here you can find the necessary .stl-parts for the different modules (cubes) and setups (apps). 

This will be a growing list of available optical setups coming along with tutorials and build instructions. The most important part is the core building block as you can also find it in every modular toolbox. A detailed description of the the **UC2** cube can be found [here](./CUBE_BASE/Readme.md). 

We have Tutorials with images now! :-)

## Printing
The .stl files can be downloaded and printed. We use an Ultimaker 2+/3 and DeeGreen which is precise enough. Note, that not all parts might be necessary to print. A detailed description or compiled list of necessary parts will follow soon.
