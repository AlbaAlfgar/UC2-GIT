# Filter Cube
This is the repository for the Filter Cube. 

The stl-files can be found in the folder [STL](./STL).

### Purpose
It adapts a filter (fluorescence) cube to the UC2 system.

## Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube

## Parts

### 3D printing parts 
The Part consists of the following components. 

* **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([LID](./STL/Assembly_Cube_Beamsplitter_10_Lid_el_v0_2.stl))
* **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([BASE](./STL/Assembly_Cube_Beamsplitter_10_Cube_v0_3.stl))
* **The Filter Cube** which holds a set of fluorescence/detection/emission filters and adapts it to the base cube ([Filterholder](./STL/Assembly_Cube_Beamsplitter_11_BS_Fluorescent_Cube_1.stl))

### Additional parts 
* 4x DIN912 M3*12 screws (non stainless steel)
* 1x Fluorescence Filter (e.g. Comar IJ 446)


## Remarks and Tips 
### 3D Printing:
* No support required in all designs 
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

## Assembly
* Insert the screw and nut in the appropriate place
* Add a spring between the part which gets bended and the back (non-moving part). 
* Remove any support and clean the part
* Insert the mirror in the appropriate hole
* Slide in the assembled Mirror part into the Cube-Base
* Add the lid and fix it using a set of M3 screws
* Done!


## Safety
Don't touch the filter's surface! 

Attention, don't cut your fingers while removing the lens from the iPhone sensor! 

Never (!) look into the laser pointer! It will damage your eye immediately!


* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LASER! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LASER WITHOUT INTEDED USE 
* BEAM HAS TO GO AWAY FROM ONESELF - ALWAYS!
