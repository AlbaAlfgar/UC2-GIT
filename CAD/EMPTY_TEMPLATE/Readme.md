## Parts

### 3D printing parts 
Here we list the 3D printed components from the ./STL folder


The Part consists of the following components. 

1. **The Base** where the ball magnets will be fed in
2. **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place
3. **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place


The function which fits into the cube is not necessarily bound to optics. It can be everything! 
An example of a mirror or raspi-cam adapter can be found in the In-Incubator Folder.

### Additional parts 
Here we list the 3D printed components from the ./STL folder
