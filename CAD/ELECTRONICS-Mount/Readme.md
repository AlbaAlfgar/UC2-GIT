## Electronics Mount
This is the repository for the Electronics Mount design. The stl-files can be found in the folder [STL](./STL).



## Purpose
This makes it possible to integrate electronics (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry, etc.) to the UC2 grid. 

You can screw all parts to the base-plate and attach it to the magnetic system.

## Properties
It connects to the UC2 magnetic grid.

## Parts

### 3D printing parts 
Here we list the 3D printed components from the ./STL folder


The Part consists of the following components. 

1. [The Base Plate](./STL/Assembly_Electronics_70_Electronics_Baseplate_1.stl)
2. [ESP32 Adapter](./STL/Assembly_Electronics_70_Electronics_ESP32_2.stl)
2. [ESP32 Adapter](./STL/Assembly_Electronics_70_Electronics_Mount_Arduino_3.stl)


## Remarks and Tips 

## Safety
Take care in case you're dealing with lasers.
