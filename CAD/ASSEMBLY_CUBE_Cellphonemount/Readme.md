## Properties
* design is derived from the Base Cube

## Parts

### 3D printing parts
Here we list the 3D printed components from the ./STL folder


The Part consists of the following components.


1. **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([LID](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_SMARTPHONE_HOLDER_v2_10_Cube_Lid.stl))
2. **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([BASE](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_SMARTPHONE_HOLDER_v2_10_Cube_Base.stl))
3. **The Smartphone holder**, on which the phone will be placed ([Smartphone Holder](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_SMARTPHONE_HOLDER_30_Smartphone_Holder.stl))



### Additional parts
* 8Ã— DIN912 M3*12 screws (non stainless steel)



## Remarks and Tips

### 3D Printing
* No support required in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)


## Assembly
* Remove any support and clean the part
* Add the lid and fix it using a set of M3 screws
* Fix the holder on the side of the cube opposite to the lid using four M3 screws
* Done!
